## Entain BE Technical Test

This test has been designed to demonstrate your ability and understanding of technologies commonly used at Entain. 

Please treat the services provided as if they would live in a real-world environment.

### Directory Structure

- `api`: A basic REST gateway, forwarding requests onto service(s).
- `racing`: A very bare-bones racing service.
- `sports`: A basic sports service with events linking teams, sports, and locations.

### Getting Started

1. Install Go (latest).

```bash
brew install go
```

... or [see here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2. Install `protoc`

```
brew install protobuf
```

... or [see here](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).

2. In a terminal window, start the racing service...

```bash
cd ./racing

go build && ./racing
➜ INFO[0000] gRPC server listening on: localhost:9000
```

3. In another terminal window, start the sports service...

```bash
cd ./sports

go build && ./sports
➜ INFO[0000] API server listening on: localhost:9001
```

4. In another terminal window, start the api service...

```bash
cd ./api

go build && ./api
➜ INFO[0000] API server listening on: localhost:8000
```

5. Make a request for all races... 

```bash
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8000/v1/list-races" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{}'
```

For all available services and their request/response formats, see the api [protodoc](./api/proto/doc/proto.md)

**Note:**

To aid in proto generation following any changes, you can run `go generate ./...` from `api` and `racing` directories.

Before you do so, please ensure you have the following installed. You can simply run the following command below in each of `api` and `racing` directories.

```
go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/api google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
```
